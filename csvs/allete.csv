The settlement resolved claims that the company violated the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act by unlawfully constructing major modifications at its plants without obtaining required permits and installing and operating the best available air pollution control technology. The settlement also required that the company pay a civil penalty of $1.4 million to resolve Clean Air Act violations and spend at least $4.2 million on environmental projects to benefit local communities. The state of Minnesota was co-plaintiff to the settlement and was to receive $200,000 of the penalty.","federal","agency action","Environmental Protection Agency referral to the Justice Department","civil","","","","","","Minnesota","","","","","","USA","Minnesota","publicly traded","ALE","utilities and power generation","utilities","http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-settlement-minnesota-coal-fired-utility-reduce-emissions",""
