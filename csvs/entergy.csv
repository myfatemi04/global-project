This action was based on a continuing SL III violation of the NRC's January 31, 2006, Confirmatory Order to implement Section 651(b) of the Energy Policy Act (Act) of 2005. The Order required Entergy to install backup power for the Indian Point Alert and Notification System (ANS) by January 31, 2007. The NRC subsequently extended, at the licensee's request, the implementation date to April 15, 2007. On April 23, 2007, the staff issued a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty in the amount of $130,000 when Entergy failed to meet the April 15, 2007, implementation date. On July 30, 2007, the NRC issued an Order to supplement the requirements of the January 31, 2006, Confirmatory Order, based on Entergy's proposed corrective actions for noncompliance with the Confirmatory Order. On August 30, 2007, the staff issued a subsequent Notice of Violation for Entergy's failure to place the new ANS in service by August 24, 2007, as required by the July 30, 2007, Order.

The Order required that the licensee provide and maintain a backup power supply for the Indian Point Emergency Notification System (ENS). Specifically, the ""radio only activation"" feature, the portion of the ENS for which the backup power capability was provided, was required to meet its test acceptance criteria by April 15, 2007.

(Entergy), to formalize commitments made as a result of an alternative dispute mediation session held on September 22, 2014. Entergy agreed that a Notice of Violation (NOV) and a civil penalty of $70,000 will be included in the CO. The specific commitments that were made as part of the settlement agreement between Entergy and the NRC regarding the apparent violation of NRC security requirements are discussed in the non-public enclosures to the CO. The violation involved the willful actions of an unidentified security officer which occurred at Entergy's River Bend Station on March 18, 2012. The NRC and Entergy agree that the actions of an unidentified security officer constitute a willful violation of 10 CFR Part 73 requirements. However, the NRC and Entergy disagree on the specific aspects of the willful characterization of the violation. In light of the significant corrective actions Entergy has already taken and the additional actions they have committed to take to enhance their security program at River Bend and across the Entergy Nuclear Fleet, the NRC is exercising enforcement discretion to reduce the severity level of the escalated enforcement sanction that was initially proposed in our preliminary determination. The NRC's rationale behind its decision to exercise enforcement discretion in characterizing the violation is incorporated in an attachment to the CO. The attachment to the CO and the NOV will not be made publicly available because it contains security-related information.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","Louisiana","publicly traded","ETR","utilities and power generation","utilities","http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/enforcement/current/reactor-actions/2014.html",""

An investigation conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations determined that on multiple occasions multiple reactor operators willfully failed to follow an Entergy procedure that prohibited internet access in the At-the-Controls area of the control room, except as specifically authorized by the Operations Manager.
