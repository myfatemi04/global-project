The automakers agreed to pay a $100 million civil penalty to resolve violations concerning the testing and certification of vehicles sold in America and spend approximately $50 million on measures to prevent any future violations.  Hyundai and Kia also agreed to forfeit 4.75 million greenhouse gas emission credits that the companies previously claimed, which are estimated to be worth over $200 million.  (The Justice Department did not provide a breakdown of the penalties between the two companies. Estimates by Automotive News were used to divided the civil penalty and the cost of the forfeited credits, while the cost of the $50 million in spending to prevent future violations is divided evenly here.
