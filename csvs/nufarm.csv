No. 264-533), Bromoxynil Octanote (EPA Reg. No. 264-442), Dichlorprop-P Technical Acid (EPA Reg. No. 15440-24), MCPA Technical Acid (EPA Reg. No. 70596-1), and Nufarm USA 2, 4-D Acid (EPA Reg. No. 61272-3). The imported products were illegal because the labels on the products either contained information that conflicted with the EPA-accepted label or had claims that substantially differed from the claims made as part of the product registration under FIFRA. Nufarm agreed to relabel the violative products, prepare and implement a compliance monitoring plan to prevent or eliminate any future violations of FIFRA, and pay a $105,000 civil penalty.
