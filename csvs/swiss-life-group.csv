Ltd. (Swiss Life Singapore), and Swiss Life (Luxembourg) S.A. (Swiss Life Luxembourg), with conspiring with U.S. taxpayers and others to conceal from the IRS more than $1.452 billion in offshore insurance policies, including more than 1,600 insurance wrapper policies, and related policy investment accounts in banks around the world and the income generated in these accounts. The Justice Department also announced a deferred prosecution agreement with the Swiss Life Entities under which they agreed to accept responsibility for their criminal conduct by stipulating to the accuracy of the Statement of Facts attached to the Agreement. The Agreement requires the Swiss Life Entities to refrain from all future criminal conduct, enhance remedial measures, and continue to cooperate fully with further investigations into hidden insurance policies and related policy investment accounts. Further, as part of the resolution, the Swiss Life Entities agreed to pay approximately $77.3 million to the U.S. Treasury, which included restitution, forfeiture of all gross fees, and a penalty component. If the Swiss Life Entities abide by all of the terms of the Agreement, the government will defer prosecution on the information for three years and then seek to dismiss the charge.","federal","agency action","Justice Department Tax Division","criminal","deferred prosecution agreement","","","","","","","","","","","Switzerland","","publicly traded","","financial services","insurance","https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/switzerland-s-largest-insurance-company-and-three-subsidiaries-admit-conspiring-us-taxpayers",""
