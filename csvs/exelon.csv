An investigation conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations determined that multiple security officers at Peach Bottom were deliberately inattentive on multiple occasions. In addition, multiple security officers deliberately failed to report observations of inattentiveness to their supervision. These security officers put Exelon in violation of 10 CFR 73.55, which requires armed responders to maintain continuous communication with each alarm station and be available to immediately respond to threats, and Peach Bottom License Condition 2.C(3), which requires, in part, reporting of aberrant behavior.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","Pennsylvania","","","","","","USA","Illinois","publicly traded","EXC","utilities and power generation","utilities","https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0835/ML083530084.pdf",""

In summary, the licensee failed to (a) keep complete records showing the inventory (including location and unique identity), transfer, and disposal of all special nuclear material (SNM) in its possession; (b) establish, maintain, and follow written MC&A procedures that were sufficient to enable the licensee to account for SNM in its possession; and (c) conduct a physical inventory of all SNM in its possession at intervals not to exceed 12 months.

On May 12, 2005, Exelon informed the NRC of its intent to appeal this enforcement action using the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process as a means to obtain resolution. In order to resolve disagreements, Exelon, The Venture, and NRC representatives met with an independent mediator on July 11, 2005. As part of the ADR settlement agreement, Exelon agreed that a willful violation occurred as documented in the NRC's May 2, 2005, NOV/CP and committed to implement numerous comprehensive short-term and long-term corrective actions. Based on the expectation that Exelon will satisfactorily implement these corrective actions, the NRC agreed to reclassify the violation at Severity Level IV, to reduce the civil penalty to $10,000, and to not consider the violation as part of the civil penalty assessment process (NRC Enforcement Policy, Section VI.C.2) should the NRC consider future enforcement actions against LaSalle.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","Illinois","","","","","","USA","Illinois","publicly traded","EXC","utilities and power generation","utilities","https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0512/ML051240220.pdf",""
