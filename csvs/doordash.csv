Attorney General announced a settlement with DoorDash, Inc., a food delivery service, requiring it to pay $2.5 million to resolve allegations that it misled D.C. consumers and used tips left for workers to boost the company's bottom line. In a November 2019 lawsuit, the Office of the Attorney General had alleged that from 2017 until 2019, DoorDash misled consumers to believe that their tips would increase worker pay, when, in fact, tips were used to subsidize DoorDash's payments to its workers. DoorDash has since revised its tips policy.
