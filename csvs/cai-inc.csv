Under a consent decree lodged by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, the owners and operator were required to pay the U.S. Government a projected $1.3 million, including cash and the net proceeds from sale of the facility property, assuming the property sold for its appraised value. Most of that recovery was to go to reimburse EPA for its $2.7 million in costs of cleaning up hazardous waste after the explosion. In addition, operator C.A.I. Inc. was required to pay EPA a penalty of $100,000 to settle allegations that conditions at the facility violated the General Duty Clause in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.
