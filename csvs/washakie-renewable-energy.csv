The stipulation of settlement was filed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. A complaint stating the government's claims was filed at the same time, announced Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. From January to October of 2010, Washakie generated more than 7.2 million renewable identification numbers (RINs) based upon its production of biodiesel at its Plymouth, Utah, facility.  During that time period, however, Washakie did not produce any biodiesel - at the Plymouth facility or anywhere else.  The biodiesel associated with the 7.2 million RINs would have accounted for a reduction of emissions equivalent to more than 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.  The stipulation of settlement required Washakie to pay a civil penalty of $3 million.","federal","agency action","Environmental Protection Agency referral to the Justice Department","civil","","","","","","Utah","Plymouth","","","","","USA","Utah","privately held","","utilities and power generation","power generation","http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/utah-based-washakie-renewable-energy-llc-settles-renewable-fuel-standard-violations",""
