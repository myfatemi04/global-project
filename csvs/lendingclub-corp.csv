Many consumers who signed up for Springstone's deferred-interest loan product at dental offices to pay for dental work were led to believe that the product was interest free. In fact, interest accrued from the date of the consumer's purchase and was charged if the balance was not paid in full before the promotional period ended. Approximately 3,200 consumers who signed up for the product ultimately were charged and paid deferred interest.","federal","agency action","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","California","publicly traded","LC","financial services","financial services","http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-springstone-financial-for-deceptive-health-care-credit-enrollment-tactics/",""
