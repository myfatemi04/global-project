The Commission asserted that OneLink Communications, Inc., TeleDias Communications, Inc., TeleUno, Inc., and Cytel, Inc., slammed consumers by switching their long distance carriers without authorization and crammed unauthorized charges onto consumers' bills.  In addition, it was alleged that the companies, which operated as a single enterprise, fabricated audio recordings that they then submitted to the FCC as proof the consumers authorized these changes and charges.","federal","agency action","Federal Communications Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","United Kingdom","","publicly traded","","telecommunications","telecommunications","https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-337720A1.pdf",""
