The CFPB and DOJ alleged that Trustmark discriminated against Black and Hispanic neighborhoods by deliberately not marketing, offering, or originating home loans to consumers in majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis metropolitan area. The CFPB and DOJ also alleged that Trustmark discouraged consumers residing in or seeking credit for properties located in these neighborhoods from applying for credit. As part of the settlement, Trustmark was to pay a $5 million penalty to the CFPB, which would credit $4 million paid to the OCC toward the satisfaction of this amount.","federal","agency action","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","Mississippi","publicly traded","TRMK","financial services","banking","https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-doj-and-occ-take-action-against-trustmark-national-bank-for-deliberate-discrimination-against-black-and-hispanic-families/",""
