Under the settlement, Hecla will pay $263.4 million plus interest to the United States, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and the state of Idaho to resolve claims stemming from releases of wastes from its mining operations. Settlement funds will be dedicated to restoration and remediation of natural resources in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. The agreement, which was lodged in federal district court in Idaho today, brings closure to that lawsuit and establishes a strong basis for future cooperation between Hecla and the governments in the Coeur d'Alene Basin.","federal","agency action","Justice Department multiagency referral","civil","","","","","","Idaho","","","","","","USA","Idaho","publicly traded","HL","mining and minerals","mining","http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/hecla-mining-company-pay-263-million-settlement-resolve-idaho-superfund-site-litigation-and",""
