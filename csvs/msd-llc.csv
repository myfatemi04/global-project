Diesel trucks that are not equipped with emission controls known as diesel particulate filters emit excess particulate matter (PM). When running, trucks without these types of controls leave behind a trail of dark, black smoke. PM is associated with a number of health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and an increased risk of lung cancer.","federal","agency action","Environmental Protection Agency referral to the Justice Department","civil","","","","","","Utah","Ogden","","","","","USA","Texas","privately held","","automotive parts","automotive parts","http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/automotive-electronics-manufacturer-fined-500000-selling-illegal-devices-resulting-tons",""
