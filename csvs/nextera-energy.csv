"Florida Power and Light Company (Turkey Point Nuclear Plant Unit 3)","NextEra Energy","$70,000","$0","$70,000","2010","20100621","safety-related offenses","nuclear safety violation","","On June 21, 2010, the NRC issued a White finding with two associated violations to Florida Power and Light Company (FP&L) as a result of inspections at Turkey Point Nuclear Plant Unit 3. This White finding involves the licensees failure to adequately address degradation of Boraflex, a fixed neutron absorber material used in the Turkey Point Unit 3 spent fuel pool. Boraflex degradation resulted in a reduction in the Boron_10 areal density of the spent fuel storage racks such that, when considering the biases and uncertainties identified in Chapter 9 of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, the effective neutron multiplication factor would not have been maintained less than 1.0 if the spent fuel pool had been flooded with unborated water. The NRC identified that FP&L had violated 10 CFR 50, Appendix B, Criterion XVI, Corrective Action, which requires that conditions adverse to quality be promptly identified and corrected, and Technical Specification 5.5.1.1.a, which requires that the spent fuel storage racks be maintained with an effective neutron multiplication factor less than 1.0 if flooded with unborated water, when considering the biases and uncertainties described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. The NRC also issued FP&L a Severity Level III Notice of Violation with a proposed $70,000 civil penalty for failure to comply with 10 CFR 50.73, which requires, in part, that licensees report any condition prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications. As discussed, Boraflex degradation led to a condition prohibited by Turkey Point Unit 3 Technical Specifications, but this condition was not reported to the NRC as required by 10 CFR 50.73.","federal","agency action","Nuclear Regulatory Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","Florida","publicly traded","NEE","utilities and power generation","utilities","https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1017/ML101730313.pdf",""

The White Finding was issued for the failure of Turkey Point personnel to maintain the effectiveness of their emergency plan, as required by 10 CFR 50.54(q) and 10 CFR 50.47(b), and the Severity Level III violation and Civil Penalty were issued for FPLs failure to make an eight hour report, as required by 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(xiii). Specifically, from December 4, 2010, to July 13, 2011, and from October 10 to October 28, 2011, FPL failed to follow and maintain the effectiveness of its emergency plan when portions of the Technical Support Center (TSC) ventilation system were removed from service for maintenance, without compensatory measures.
