The settlements resolved allegations that the hospitals overcharged Medicare between 2000 and 2008 when performing kyphoplasty, a minimally-invasive procedure used to treat certain spinal fractures that often are due to osteoporosis. In many cases, the procedure can be performed safely as a less costly out-patient procedure, but the government contends that the hospitals performed the procedure on an in-patient basis in order to increase their Medicare billings.","federal","agency action","Justice Department Civil Division","civil","","","","","","South Carolina","Columbia","","","","","USA","South Carolina","non-profit","","healthcare services","hospitals","https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-hospitals-seven-states-pay-us-more-94-million-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations",""
