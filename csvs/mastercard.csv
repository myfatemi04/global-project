In October 2015, a rash of preventable failures by Mastercard and UniRush meant that many customers could not use their RushCard to get their paychecks and other direct deposits, take out cash, make purchases, pay bills, or get accurate balance information. UniRush then failed to provide customer service to many consumers who reached out for help during the service breakdown. The CFPB ordered Mastercard and UniRush to pay an estimated $10 million in restitution to tens of thousands of harmed customers and fined Mastercard and UniRush $3 million.","federal","agency action","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","New York","publicly traded","NYSE: MA","financial services","financial services","http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-mastercard-and-unirush-pay-13-million-rushcard-breakdowns-cut-consumers-access-funds/",""
