The trial judge threw out that award and ordered a new trial. In 2002 another jury awarded $30 million in punitive damages but the judge said that unless the plaintiffs accepted a lower amount he would order a new trial. Two of the six plaintiffs accepted a total of $4.5 million in punitives plus the $300,000 they had been awarded in compensatory damages. In 2006 a state appeals court ruled that the damages for the other plaintiffs should be six times their $250,000 in compensatory damages, which amounted to a total of $1.75 million.
