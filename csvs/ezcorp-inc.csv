These tactics allegedly included visits to consumers at their homes and workplaces, empty threats of legal action, lying about consumers' rights, and exposing consumers to bank fees through unlawful electronic withdrawals. The Bureau ordered EZCORP to refund $7.5 million to 93,000 consumers, pay $3 million in penalties, and stop collection of remaining payday and installment loan debts owed by roughly 130,000 consumers. It also bars EZCORP from future in-person debt collection.","federal","agency action","Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","Texas","publicly traded","EZPW","financial services","pawnshops","http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-ezcorp-to-pay-10-million-for-illegal-debt-collection-tactics/",""
