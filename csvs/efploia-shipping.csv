The companies were each sentenced by U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis to pay $1.2 million and serve three years of probation during which they will be required to implement a government approved environmental plan that includes audits conducted by an independent firm and review by a court appointed monitor. Efploia Shipping, a Marshall Islands corporation based in Greece, was the technical manager of the M/V Aquarosa, a 33,005 gross ton newly built cargo ship, constructed in China and registered in Malta. Aquarosa Shipping, a company based in Denmark, was the owner of the vessel. Both corporations pleaded guilty today to four felony counts: obstruction of justice, making material false statements, and the environmental crimes of knowingly failing to maintain an accurate oil record book and knowingly failing to maintain an accurate garbage record book, both in violation of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS).","federal","agency action","Justice Department multiagency referral","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","Greece","","privately held","","freight and logistics","ocean shipping","http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-shipping-corporations-plead-guilty-and-are-sentenced-maryland-obstruction-justice-and",""
