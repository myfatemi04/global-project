The department found that Gap discriminated against workers by reverifying their permission to work, even though there was no legal reason to do so. The department also determined that Gap discriminated against some non-U.S. citizens because of their immigration status by requesting that they provide specific documents to confirm that they still had permission to work.","federal","agency action","Justice Department Civil Rights Division","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","California","publicly traded","GPS","retailing","retail-apparel","https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-settlement-gap-inc-while-celebrating-35th-anniversary-law",""
