The bushing puller tool and air hoist hook were secured to an anchor post after the bushings were replaced. It was also observed that the driller's view of the entangled air hoist cable was obstructed by the traveling block and top drive. The downward force of the traveling block and top drive put an undetermined amount of force on the cable and anchor post, breaking the post from the rig floor allowing either the anchor post or the bushing puller tool to strike the injured party.
