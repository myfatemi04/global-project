BBC pleaded guilty to one count of major fraud against the United States in connection with a criminal information filed in the District of Columbia. U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan accepted the plea and sentenced BBC to pay over $33.6 million in criminal fines and over $31.8 million in restitution to the U.S. military, serve three years of probation, and engage an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years. Separately, BBC also entered into a False Claims Act settlement with the United States to resolve its civil liability for $35.2 million.
