The SEC alleged that AVEO Pharmaceuticals Inc. concealed the FDA's level of concern about Tivozanib in public statements to investors by omitting the critical fact that FDA staff had recommended a second clinical trial to address their concerns about patient death rates during the first clinical trial.  When the FDA made public months later that it had recommended an additional clinical trial, the company's stock price declined 31 percent.  AVEO never conducted an additional trial, and the FDA later refused to approve Tivozanib.","federal","agency action","Securities and Exchange Commission","civil","","","","","","","","","","","","USA","Massachusetts","publicly traded","AVEO","pharmaceuticals","biopharmaceuticals","https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-59.html",""
